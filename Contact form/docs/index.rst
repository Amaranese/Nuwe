django-contact-form |release|
=============================

django-contact-form provides customizable contact-form functionality
for `Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_-powered Web sites.

Basic functionality (collecting a name, email address and message) can
be achieved out of the box by setting up a few templates and adding
one line to your site's root URLconf:

.. code-block:: python

    path('contact/', include('contact_form.urls')),

For notes on getting started quickly, and on how to customize
django-contact-form's behavior, read through the full documentation
